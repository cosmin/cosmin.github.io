# About

After nearly a decade of consulting and training across software
development, information security and IT operations I founded
[Rising Oak](http://www.risingoak.com), where I apply my broad
technology background and a passion for solving problems to help
mid-market companies solve problems at the intersection of business
and technology.

I have lived in Dallas for most of the past 4 years, although I spent
a good part of that time on the road: Seattle, Portland, Chicago, San
Francisco, New York, London, Bangalore, Beijing, Xi'an, Melbourne and
Sydney. Being located next to the DFW International Airport is a huge
plus when consulting.
