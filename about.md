# About

I currently live nearby Dallas, TX, where I run a boutique technology
consulting and training firm, specializing in continuous delivery and
cloud infrastructure. I have a background that blends software
engineering, operations and information security, which I have done
professionally since 2004. You can read more about my background on
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/cosmin).

When I'm not consulting I enjoy building web and mobile applications,
contributing to open source projects, and occasionally writing
articles on this site. I am also trying to improve my design
skills. You can find me sharing links and talking about these topics
on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/offbytwo).
