I was at the <a href="http://www.openstack.org/blog/2010/09/the-second-openstack-design-conference/">OpenStack Design Summit</a> this week and I wanted to check out the latest release of Swift, OpenStack's blob storage technology. The <a href="http://swift.openstack.org/development_saio.html">Swift All In One</a> guide contains everything necessary to get started with Swift on a development machine, but it involves far too much effort for my tastes.

I decided to quickly automate the entire process with a single bash script. So now you can get started with Swift with two commands on a new Ubuntu 10.10 VM

<code>wget http://offbytwo.com/scripts/try-swift-on-ubuntu.sh</code>
<code>bash try-swift-on-ubuntu.sh devauth</code>

There is actually a far better way to get Swift up and running in an automated fashion using Chef (and possibly Vagrant), but I'll leave that for another post.
